# Ottodot Full-Stack Engineer Take-Home

_Trial Booking Reliability | AI tools welcome | Timebox: 3-4 hours_

**Please cap your time at 4 hours. If you run out of time, leave notes on what you would do next.**

We encourage you to use AI tools. We are interested in how you steer it, question it, and ship something great.

## Context

Ottodot runs live online science and math classes for kids. Parents need to book and pay a trial class for their child, and our team needs an accurate roster before class starts.

Trial classes are capped at **4 students per class**.

Your task is to build the smallest working slice of a trial booking system that behaves correctly under important edge cases.

---

## What To Build

**Implement trial booking only. Do not implement regular enrollment.**

Your solution should allow:

1. A parent to choose a child and pick an available trial class.
2. A parent to submit a trial booking.
3. A mock payment step or payment result to be recorded.
4. The booking status to be shown after submission.
5. An admin or teacher to see the trial class roster or a simple roster API/output.

Your solution must prevent or handle:

- duplicate confirmed bookings for the same child and class
- overbooking beyond 4 confirmed students
- payment failure without incorrectly adding the child to the confirmed roster
- the last-seat race condition described below

A polished frontend is not required. A simple UI is useful, but we care more about the data model, backend logic, invariants, tests, and your explanation. A CLI, script, API endpoint, server action, or minimal app is fine if it shows your thinking clearly.

## Required Technical Scenario: Last-Seat Race

Please explicitly handle or explain this scenario:

1. User A selects the last available slot and moves to payment.
2. User B selects the same slot.
3. User B completes payment first and confirms the booking.
4. User A then tries to complete payment.

**Your implementation must ensure that at most one user can end up with a confirmed booking for the last available seat.**

In your README, explain:

- the approach you chose
- why you chose it
- what tradeoffs you accepted

---

## Backend Design Requirements

In your README, include a short backend/design section covering:

- your data model or schema
- the key API endpoints, server actions, or backend functions
- booking statuses used, such as `pending_payment`, `confirmed`, `payment_failed`, `cancelled`, or similar
- how you prevent duplicate bookings
- how you handle payment failure
- how you handle two users competing for the last seat
- which checks belong in the UI, backend, database, or background job

---

## Suggested Model

Use a small synthetic dataset. You can create it in any format you prefer: seed file, JSON, CSV, SQLite, Postgres, Supabase, or in-memory data.

Useful concepts may include:

- `parents`
- `students`
- `trial_classes`
- `bookings`
- `payment_attempts`

You may add fields if useful, but keep the model small.

---

## Seed Data And Edge Cases

Please include seed data or setup steps so we can run the demo quickly.

Include enough cases to show:

- a class with available seats
- a class with exactly 3 confirmed students
- a duplicate booking attempt for the same child and class
- a payment failure case

---

## What To Submit

1. Please submit a link to a public GitHub repo containing your implementation containing:
   - `README.md`
   - your implementation
   - synthetic data or setup instructions
   - tests or clear verification steps
   - `AI_USAGE.md`
   - _Note: Zip files are not accepted._
2. A link to a short video walkthrough (5–8 minutes) — screen recording of you running the solution and briefly explaining your approach, the last-seat race handling, and any tradeoffs. Loom, YouTube (unlisted), or similar is fine.

### README

Your `README.md` should explain:

- how to run your solution
- what you built
- time spent
- assumptions you made
- key architecture and backend decisions
- what you deliberately cut
- what you would monitor after release
- what you would do next with more time

### AI_USAGE.md

Your `AI_USAGE.md` should explain:

- which AI tools you used
- what you used AI for
- one place where AI helped you move faster
- one place where you disagreed with, corrected, or rejected AI output
- what you would change about your AI workflow if you had to do this again
- how you verified the final implementation

---

## Evaluation

We will look for:

- backend and data-model judgment
- correctness under payment and double-booking edge cases
- a working full-stack or backend-led flow
- sensible tests or verification
- clear scope control
- clear communication

Please prioritize correct backend behavior, clear edge-case handling, and verification over frontend polish or feature breadth.
